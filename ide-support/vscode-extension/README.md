# Helidon support for Visual Studio Code

This extension helps users to generate a Helidon project, develop and run it.

The [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) extension is optional 
but recommended for the installation in Visual Studio Code to support Java projects. 

## Requirements

* Maven 3.8.2 or newer is required to be installed in your system.
* Java 17 or newer is required to be installed in your system.

## Features

The Helidon extension provides:

* Helidon project creation wizard
* Start/stop Developer Loop (as you make source code changes the project will automatically recompile and restart your
  application)
* Auto completion for configuration properties files (application.yaml, microprofile-config.properties, etc.)

## How to open the start page for the extension

* Open Command Palette using `View -> Command Pallette...` from the top menu bar or by shortcut for this command for your Operating System
   (for Windows and Linux - `Ctrl+Shift+A`, for Mac - `Cmd+Shift+P`).
* Start typing `Helidon`

## How to start Helidon Dev Loop

* Open Command Palette
* Start typing `Helidon`
* Choose `Helidon: Start Helidon Dev Loop`
* If a workspace contains only one Helidon project, `Helidon Dev Loop` starts automatically. If the workspace contains more than one
   Helidon project, you will be asked to choose a directory to start `Helidon Dev Loop`.

## Configuration of the extension

Helidon VSCode extension has three options that can be configured in the settings of the extension :
* Helidon: Show Start Page (`helidon.showStartPage`) :
  
  If start page should be displayed on the extension startup. 
  
  Default value - true.
* Helidon: Maven Home Dir (`helidon.mavenHomeDir`) :
  
  Path to the directory where Apache Maven is installed that will be used by the plugin.
  
  Default value - empty string (default Maven version for your Operating System will be used).
* Helidon: Java Home Dir (`helidon.javaHomeDir`) :
  
  Path to the JAVA_HOME directory of the installed JDK that will be used by the plugin.

## How to test

* Clone the project [helidon-build-tools](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon-build-tools)
* You will need to build a module `ide-support` using `Maven`. This module contains backend and frontend parts of the VSCode extension,
 its dependencies and a maven plugin that is used by `Helidon Language Server`. 
* Open the module `helidon-vscode-extension` in `VS Code`.
* Run it
